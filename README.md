Various utility/fun cogs for Red.
My repo already starting to revolve around various Xbox or game server related cogs, some of which will make extensive use of API's to pull data for the players.

| Cog | Status | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| ArkTools | ✓ | <details><summary>Connect to your ark servers and chat seamlessly between in-game and discord.</summary> This cog includes many utility features for overseeing your server including a status channel, join/leave logs, blacklisting player names, and admin command logging.</details> |
| Inspire | ✓ | <details><summary>Get inpsirational messages.</summary> Super simple cog that replies to certain sad words with positive encouragements using zenquotes.io API. Note: this cog was my very first project just to get the feel for Red so it's not very big and there arent any plans of expanding it at the moment.</details>|
| MCTools | ✓ | <details><summary>Get your Xbox profile info in a clean embed.</summary> Various other tools for Xbox using xbl.io API coming soon.  (You will need to register for a key to use this cog. "its free though")</details> |
| XTools | ✓ | <details><summary>Super simple status cog for Minecraft Bedrock servers.</summary> Only for **Bedrock** dedicated servers since there is already one that supports Java.</details> |

# Installation
Run the following commands with your Red instance, replacing `[p]` with your prefix:

If you havent loaded the Downloader cog already, go ahead and do that first with: `[p]load downloader`. Then, 
```ini
[p]repo add vrt-cogs https://github.com/vertyco/vrt-cogs
[p]cog install vrt-cogs <list of cogs>
[p]load <list of cogs>
```

# Feature Requests & Bounties
I am always open to any ideas or suggestions for new cogs/features, however I may not take any paid bounties for quite a while as I am still relatively new to python and the coding world in general.
