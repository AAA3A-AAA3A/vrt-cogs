Various utility/fun cogs for Red V3.

I am relatively new to Python and coding in general, and enjoy working with API's and utility cogs for game servers. I plan on focusing in a niche of server management cogs but am keeping an open mind about any ideas that might interest me.

| Cog | Status | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| ArkTools | ✓ | <details><summary>Connect to your ark servers and chat seamlessly between in-game and discord.</summary> This cog includes many utility features for overseeing your server including a status channel, join/leave logs, auto-renaming blacklisting player names, and admin command logging.</details> |
| Inspire | ✓ | <details><summary>Get inpsirational messages.</summary> Super simple cog that replies to certain sad words with positive encouragements using zenquotes.io API. Note: this cog was my very first project just to get the feel for Red so it's not very big and there arent any plans of expanding it at the moment.</details>|
| MCTools | ✓ | <details><summary>Super simple status cog for Minecraft Bedrock servers.</summary> Only for **Bedrock** dedicated servers since there is already one that supports Java.</details> |
| XTools | ✓ | <details><summary>View your Xbox profile, friends, screenshots and game clips using simple commands.</summary> Various tools for Xbox using xbl.io and xapi.us APIs.  (You will need to register for a free key to use this cog. The profile and friends command uses only xbl.io but the use a combination of the two.)</details> |

# Installation
Run the following commands with your Red instance, replacing `[p]` with your prefix:

If you havent loaded the Downloader cog already, go ahead and do that first with: `[p]load downloader`. Then, 
```ini
[p]repo add vrt-cogs https://github.com/vertyco/vrt-cogs
[p]cog install vrt-cogs <list of cogs>
[p]load <list of cogs>
```
